Plan

To Be a Auto-Moderator / Custom Commands / Other


About Me!
---------

On the front-end,
I'm showing stuff. Yay!

On the back-end,
- Im a coded Project! I start by reading `server.js`.
- safely store my secrets in `.env` (Oy! dont touch me!)

I Have a database!
- I use sqlite but you can power your Guys with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
-Here is the Nerd stuff. `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. you can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs". so basicly you cant get my Token of life. (someone would hate that to happen anyways.)
